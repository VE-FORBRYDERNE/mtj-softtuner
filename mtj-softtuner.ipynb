It is recommended to set `lr` to somewhere in the `1e-5` to `5e-5` range. Higher `lr` results in the trainer having a stronger effect. Values higher than around `7e-5` tend to result in exploding gradients (numerical instability) and should be avoided! You can tell when this happens because the Gradient L2 Norm will start increasing abnormally and eventually \"explode\" to values in the thousands. If the trainer still isn't strong enough, you should train with more epochs instead of risking the numerical instability.\n",

    "* `end_lr_multiplier` (`float` > 0): After the warmup steps, the remaining training steps have a learning rate controlled by a cosine function that goes from the maximum learning rate to this proportion of the maximum learning rate (i.e. the default is one-tenth of the maximum learning rate).\n",
    "* `weight_decay` (`float` between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive): The soft prompt you're going to train is actually a two-dimensional array of floating-point numbers. The absolute values of the numbers tend to be pretty small (less than 1). If the absolute value of one of those numbers grows too large, the trainer tends to try to reduce the absolute values of the entire array, resulting in the entire array being filled with zeros and ruining your soft prompt. This setting effectively restricts the absolute value of the numbers in the array (higher weight decay value means the maximum absolute value is lower) to help prevent this scenario. Of course, setting it too high would lower the absolute value of your array, too, just like what would happen if you'd set it too low, so there's usually an optimal value. People have suggested 0.1 as a good all-around weight decay factor.\n",
    "* `max_grad_norm` (`float` > 0): Controls the maximum allowed rate at which the soft prompt can be trained, so if the trainer tries to change the soft prompt by too much in one step, the changes will be scaled down uniformly. Lower values are more restrictive. If the \"Gradient L2 Norm\" is much higher (e.g. at least twice as much) on average than this value, you should probably raise this value."
